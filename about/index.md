About 
<!-- I'm an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the [lab for data-intensive biology at UC Davis](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/), advised by [Titus Brown](https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/c-titus-brown). My work focuses on building bioinformatic tools to enable ecological and evolutionary genome and transcriptome analyses, particularly in non-model species. For more, go [here](http://bluegenes.github.io/research/). I'm particularly interested in bringing more diverse perspectives into marine science and omics work, and teach bioinformatics and genomics workshops through [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and at Davis ([DIBSI](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/2017/#data-intensive-biology-summer-institute-at-uc-davis), [Non-model RNAseq](https://dibsi-rnaseq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).


in 2017, I received my PhD from [Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD,](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) advised by [Ron Burton](http://burtonlab.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html/) and [Terry Gaasterland](http://genomes.ucsd.edu/). I conducted interdisciplinary research focusing on the response of the California market squid, *Doryteuthis opalescens*, to low oxygen and low pH conditions. For more, go [here](http://bluegenes.github.io/research/). As part of TIDES (Team for Inclusion of Diversity in Education and Science), I worked towards the recruitment and hiring of a diversity officer and building a plan for improving campus climate at SIO. 

You can also find me nerding out over coffee and books, or hiking across hillsides with my incredible dog, [Loba](http://bluegenes.github.io/loba/).
